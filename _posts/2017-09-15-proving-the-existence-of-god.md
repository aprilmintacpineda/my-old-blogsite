description: People say that believing in God is a personal preference, so is not, but if you are given thousands of reasons to believe in God and one reason not to believe in God, the choice should be obvious.

# Prolouge

The existence of God has been debated for more than a century now. People who take part in this activity can be categorized as by their faith.

### Strong Christian

Their faith to God is strong and not easily destroyed. They have fully decided that God exists without a doubt and they can prove that to anyone who challenges their faith. They are wise and they do research about the existence of God. They read a lot of books including the Holy Bible. They will say "God exists!" then support their argument by truths they gathered from their research.

### Fragile Christian

Their faith is fragile. They believe that God exists but somehow they still have this doubt that occupies a huge portion of their belief. They can't prove their belief because they don't do research and do not read the bible. Anyone who challenges their faith will win with ease.

### Strong Atheist

They don't have any faith at all. They are willingly disproving the existence of God. They continue to search for reasons not to believe in God and they continue to seek ways to disprove his existence.

### Fragile Atheist

They are in doubt if they are Atheist or not. In reality, they were merely affected by **social experience**, they saw this Atheist that uses science and logic to disprove that God exists and they thought it's cool so they mimicked his behaviour. In reality they don't seek for reason not to believe in God and they can't even prove their beliefs to others. They will say "God does not exists" and then stop there because they can't support their arguments with anything, not even with a hypothesis.

So to summarize, both Christians and Atheists may fall under **Strong** or **Fragile** which basically tells you if they can prove anything or nothing at all. Keep in mind that these are not static or constant things, beliefs are in constant change. They may change from being **fragile to strong**, **strong to fragile**, **Christian to Atheist**, or **Atheist to Christian**. We may really never know what really changes the mind of a person, but we know that it changes.

# Reasons why a person may becomes an Atheist

### Social Experience

Many people become Atheists because of the way they were raised and the environment they were raised in. Most Atheists were raised in an environment where majority of the population are atheists, therefore, there is a big chance that they will inherit the belief of the majority because of a typical human's mindset, **Majority wins**. Most people became Atheists at a very young age where they lack sufficient intelligence to observe, investigate, and criticize the belief of others in the most effective way.

### Mindset

Many people become Atheists because they think there is no evidence for God's existence.

> It is wrong always, everywhere, and for anyone to believe anything upon insufficient evidence. ~ W. K. Clifford (1879)

Other people become atheists because they believe that science explains everything and that science has ruled out the neccesity for a God. They think that we don't need a **creator** to exist.

They argue that the entire universe and everything that exists in it (or at least everything that we **KNOW** exists in it) can be explained by science and that we don't need the existence of another being to create it.

### Assumptions

Other people become Atheists because they believe that one must first assume the negative and leave the onus to others who assume the positive. They think that they should first not believe in God until the Christians can finally present an evidence that will convince them to the maximum level.

> If it is to be established that there is a God, then we have to have good grounds for believing that this is indeed so.
Until and unless some such grounds are produced we have literally no reason at all for believing; and in that situation the only reasonable posture must be that of either the negative atheist or the agnostic.
So the onus of proof has to rest on the proposition.
It must be up to them: first, to give whatever sense they choose to the word 'God', meeting any objection that so defined it would relate only to an incoherent pseudo-concept; and, second, to bring forward sufficient reasons to warrant their claim that, in their present sense of the word 'God', there is a God. ~ Anthony Flew

### The Problem of Evil

This video from [CrashCourse](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCX6b17PVsYBQ0ip5gyeme-Q) explains the **logical problem of Evil** and some theodicies.

<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9AzNEG1GB-k" allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0"></iframe>

Many Christian believes in a God that is Good, All-knowing, and All-powerful, but the existence of **evil** in this world has raised the question

> If God is good, all-knowing, and all-powerful then why don't he remove evil in this world?

- God is unwilling to prevent evil, in which case he is not good.
- God doesn't know about evil, in which case he does not know everything.
- God can't prevent evil, in which case he is not all powerful.

# Let's answer all these

### Social Experience

Everyone grew up with the same and different social experiences, therefore, making each and everyone of us unique from everyone else. Social experiences gathered from our environment such as the school, neighborhood, family, peers, and even social media really influence the way we see the world and other things in it. Some of us were lucky enough to experience the best part of life while others grew in pain and despair and died without experiencing the best part of being alive.

Everyone may be different, but I am sure we all have one thing in common.

> We all make choices in life.

I could have chosen not to write this post, but I chose to write it. I could have pursued my wild dream of becoming a rock star but instead I pursued a career in the software industry. I could have slept early last night, but instead I stayed late at night watching youtube videos.

They could have chosen the path of a Christian, but instead, they chose the path of an Atheist.

> We may not be able to choose what experiences we will have because of a lot of factors such as other people's influence, but we can always choose how it affects our life by how we perceive those experiences.

In short, social experience should not be used as a reason to deny the existence of God.

### Mindset

In my own logical opinion, our mindset is the result of our social experiences and our perception. Mindset is not something that remains constant in one year, in our generation where social experience is almost inevitable, our mindset constantly changes. I think the biggest factor that affects our mindset is our environment, mix yourself with people whose mindset is to **have fun because life is short**, chances are, you will inherit their mindset, they will inherit your mindset, or you leave them be and mix yourself with some other groups.

> Our mindset should not be a basis to prove or disprove something, because if we do so, then our decision is affected by self-serving bias.

###### There is no evidence for God's existence

**There are a lot of evidence for God's existence** but most atheists choose not to consider those evidence because in reality, their only purpose is to disprove the existence of God and not to find out if God really exists or not, therefore, the things that they will do are affected by self-serving bias.

###### Science explains everything

**Yes it does, but it does not *PROVE* everything it explains**. So far, science is only good at telling us a lot of **theories** but it can't prove all those theories, for instance, the **Big Bang Theory** that attempted to explain what happened at the very beginning of the universe, cannot be proven because we have no way of experimenting on it. Other than that, it only explained what happened at the very beginning of the universe, it left us with the question: **How did the universe exist?**

### Assumptions

Assuming that people who choose the confirmative side has the biggest duty to prove their belief is illogical. I think everyone is equally responsible in proving their claims.

### The Problem of Evil

The problem with **The Problem of Evil** is that it should not be used by Atheists. If someone who proclaims to be an Atheist used this as an argument, then he is not an Atheist at all.

This argument, already assumes that God exists but disagrees with the following characteristics of God:

- God is Good.
- God is all-knowing.
- God is all-powerful.

It argues that:

> If God is Good, all-knowing, and all-powerful, then why does he let evil exists in the world?

Well, this question is quite broad, answering it without prior analysis would not be a wise choice. Firstly let's ask ourselves these three questions:

- what is **evil**?
- what is **NOT evil**?
- Is **evil** something like a force that affects existence?

###### What is evil?

> profound immorality, wickedness, and depravity, especially when regarded as a supernatural force. ~ Google

###### What is NOT evil?

Well, in order to know this, we must first know the **synonyms** and **antonyms** of evil.

The following are some of the synonyms of evil:

- Immoral
- Disagreeable
- Wicked
- Bad
- Harmful

The following are some of the antonyms of evil:

- Moral
- Agreeable
- Virtuous
- Good
- Beneficial

That means that **NOT evil** is about doing moral, agreeable, virtuous, good, or beneficial acts and **evil** is about doing immoral, disagreeable, wicked, bad, or harmful acts.

###### So is it a force that affects existence?

Hmmm, in my own logical opinion, **yes, it is**, but not like a force brought by a ball flying at the speed of 400 kph. It is a force brought by necessity, a constraint. You see, our very existence causes what we know as evil. We need to eat, so we kill plants and other animals. We give ourselves something good but in exchange we cause them harm. Our needs cause evil to others, but why are these things not counted as evil? Why is throwing harmful chemicals to the bodies of water not counted as evil? Why is deforestation not counted as evil?

Simply because we see them as non-intelligent beings, we think that they are not intelligent enough to be self-aware, but is a chicken crying out loud while being butchered, is that being not self-aware? The chicken knows he will be killed, it knows that harm is on the way so it cries out loud as if begging for its life. A Dear running away after hearing a gun shot, isn't that self-awareness? The Dear knows that danger is near so it runs for its life. Something that a **not self-aware** being will not do.

###### So as an answer

> Evil is something that violates one's moral conduct, and if you observe, it is only exclusive to humans.

# Non-biblical historical accounts of Christ

### Christ's suffering was mentioned in Roman history

> But all human efforts, all the lavish gifts of the emperor, and the propitiations of the gods, did not banish the sinister belief that the conflagration was the result of an order. Consequently, to get rid of the report, Nero fastened the guilt and inflicted the most exquisite tortures on a class hated for their abominations, called Christians by the populace. Christus, from whom the name had its origin, suffered the extreme penalty during the reign of Tiberius at the hands of one of our procurators, Pontius Pilatus, and a most mischievous superstition... ~ Cornelius Tacitus annals Book 15 verse 44

Roman historian, [Cornelius Tacitus](https://www.google.com.ph/search?q=cornelius+tacitus&rlz=1C1CHBF_enPH717PH717&oq=cornelius+tacitus&aqs=chrome..69i57j69i61l3j0l2.4543j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) himself wrote the name of Christ in his annals. Now this is outside the bible.

### The bible was mentioned in the ancient history

> It seems both here, and in God's parallel blessing to Jacob, ch. 19. sect. 1, that Josephus had yet no notion of the hidden meaning of that most important and most eminent promise, "In thy seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed. He saith not, and of seeds, as of many, but as of one; and to thy seed, which is Christ," Galatians 3:16. Nor is it any wonder, he being, I think, as yet not a Christian. And had he been a Christian, yet since he was, to be sure, till the latter part of his life, no more than an Ebionite Christian, who, above all the apostles, rejected and despised St. Paul, it would be no great wonder if he did not now follow his interpretation. In the mean time, we have in effect St. Paul's exposition in the Testament of Reuben, sect. 6, in Authent. Rec. Part I. p. 302, who charges his sons "to worship the seed of Judah, who should die for them in visible and invisible wars; and should be among them an eternal king." Nor is that observation of a learned foreigner of my acquaintance to be despised, who takes notice, that as seeds in the plural, must signify posterity, so seed in the singular may signify either posterity, or a single person; and that in this promise of all nations being happy in the seed of Abraham, or Isaac, or Jacob, etc. it is always used in the singular. To which I shall add, that it is sometimes, as it were, paraphrased by the son of Abraham, the son of David, etc., which is capable of no such ambiguity. ~ Flavius Josephus Antiquities of the Jews Book 1 Chapter 22 Verse 29

Jewish historian [Flavius Josephus](https://www.google.com.ph/search?q=Flavius+Josephus&rlz=1C1CHBF_enPH717PH717&oq=Flavius+Josephus&aqs=chrome..69i57j69i60j69i59j69i60j0l2.344j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) mentioned the bible on many of his works, he even mentioned the coming of the Christ. He also mentioned a lot of other people, like Solomon, who were mentioned in the bible as well. He explicitly mentioned the name **Jesus Christ** on **Antiquities of the Jews Book 10 Chapter 11 End notes section 19**.

# This made me wonder...

- When did humans started doubting the existence of God?
- Did the people of the ancient time debated over the existence of God?

# Don't take my words for it...

My answer is based on a perspective of a human being. God lives in a different realm, a realm where **evil** and **not evil** may mean something else or may change according to the situation. God's perspective will be different from that of a human.
