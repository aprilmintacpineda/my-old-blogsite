My computer got infected by a virus called [Win32/Gamarue](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/wdsi/threats/malware-encyclopedia-description?Name=Win32/Gamarue){:target="_blank"}. I really don't know where I got this virus, I didn't download or install any program and whenever I download anything, as a safety precaution, I will scan the file before opening it. It could be that I got this [malware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malware){:target="_blank"} from one of the USB flash drives that were plugged into my computer the day before I notice the infection.

### Noticeable abnormal behaviours.

![Malware detected!](/blog/public/post-resources/2017-08-12-how-to-remove-win-gamarue-virus/1.png)

My antivirus, [Windows Defender](){:target="_blank"}, detected the malware immediately and quarantine it. I clicked remove because I don't want malwares lying around my PC.

![Needs to restart](/blog/public/post-resources/2017-08-12-how-to-remove-win-gamarue-virus/3.png)

My antivirus says I need to restart my PC so I did just that. When I restarted my PC, I noticed something on my taskbar...

![Powershell running on startup](/blog/public/post-resources/2017-08-12-how-to-remove-win-gamarue-virus/powershell-running.png)

A program called [powershell](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/mt173057.aspx){:target="_blank"} was running on startup, **That's inconceivable!** So I thought, there is something fishy going on here, I didn't add that program on my startup programs and yet it runs on startup, now don't get this wrong, powershell itself is not a threat, it's a tool that comes with windows and every windows PC has it.

### Here's how to remove it, once and for all.

Lots of malwares use powershell to install themselves again when you remove them, but to do that, they will add a powershell script on start up. So what you can do is to remove them from the start up programs. First you need to **Show all hidden files, folders, and drives** in your PC. To do that follow these steps or skip if you already have done and all hidden files, folders, and drives in your PC are shown.

**NOTE**: These came from [Microsoft's website](https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/14201/windows-show-hidden-files){:target="_blank"}

###### Windows 10

- In the search box on the taskbar, type **folder**, and then select **Show hidden files and folders** from the search results.
- Under **Advanced settings**, select **Show hidden files, folders, and drives**, and then select **OK**.

###### Windows 8.1

- Swipe in from the right edge of the screen, then select **Search** (or if you're using a mouse, point to the upper-right corner of the screen, move the mouse pointer down, and then select **Search**).
- Type **folder** in the search box, then select **Folder Options** from the search results.
- Select the **View** tab.
- Under **Advanced settings**, select **Show hidden files, folders, and drives**, and then select **OK**.

###### Windows 7 

- Select the **Start button**, then select **Control Panel > Appearance and Personalization**.
- Select **Folder Options**, then select the **View** tab.
- Under **Advanced settings**, select **Show hidden files, folders, and drives**, and then select **OK**.

Once all the hidden files, folders, and drives are shown, next is to go to the startup programs

- Go to **My computer** (windows 7) or **This PC** (windows 10).
- Go to your **Drive C:**, this can be named anything, mine was **Acer(C:)**.
- Go to **Users** folder.
- Go to **Your Username** folder, this can vary depending on your username, mine is **aprilpineda**.
- Go to **AppData**, this folder is hidden by default.
- Go to **Roaming > Microsoft > Windows > Start Menu > Programs**.

You will now see the list of all the programs that runs on your PC's startup, this means that all these programs will automatically run when you start your PC. It should look somewhat like mine:

**NOTE**: I am using **Windows 10**.

![Startup programs](/blog/public/post-resources/2017-08-12-how-to-remove-win-gamarue-virus/startup programs.png)

As you can see, **Windows PowerShell** is running on startup, and if you open it:

![Startup programs - Windows PowerShell](/blog/public/post-resources/2017-08-12-how-to-remove-win-gamarue-virus/Windows powershell folder.png)

We don't want **Windows PowerShell** running on startup, so delete the entire folder for good. Once it has been deleted, the malware will no longer run, but it's still there so this is not the end yet, but you are almost there.

This malware has most-likely infected your **Registry**, which windows will look at whenever its trying to run a program on startup, we need to delete that entry as well to clear your PC from the malware. First you will need to download some tools from microsoft.

To clean the registry, download the [autoruns for windows](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/autoruns){:target="_blank"}

![DL Autoruns for windows](/blog/public/post-resources/2017-08-12-how-to-remove-win-gamarue-virus/dl-autoruns for windows.png)

Once the file has been downloaded, put it in a folder, anywhere you like, it will be a **rar** file so make sure you have [downloaded and install winrar](http://www.rarlab.com/download.htm){:target="_blank"}, then **right click > Extract Here** as shown in the image below.

![extract autoruns](/blog/public/post-resources/2017-08-12-how-to-remove-win-gamarue-virus/extract autoruns.png)

All the files will be extracted to the folder, then on the **Autoruns.exe**, **right click > Run as administrator**. You will see all the programs registered in the registry, look for a malicious program similar to what you see in the image below, then **right click > Jump to entry**.

![Jump to entry](/blog/public/post-resources/2017-08-12-how-to-remove-win-gamarue-virus/jump to entry.png)

You will know if that's the program you are looking for if you click on it and you see this at the bottom.

![Value of the script](/blog/public/post-resources/2017-08-12-how-to-remove-win-gamarue-virus/value at the bottom of it.png)

You see that the File it is refering to was not found because I have removed it from the startup program, and my antivirus has deleted the file, but while this is existing in the registry, you will not be safe.

If you have found it, and you jumped to the entry, the **Registry Editor** will open and you will see the file highlighted for you, if not then click it manually, then **right click > Delete** as shown in the image below.

![Registry](/blog/public/post-resources/2017-08-12-how-to-remove-win-gamarue-virus/delete the entry on regedit.png)

It's most-likely that a dialogue box will appear to confirm that you want to delete, it just click yes and the entry will be delete.

###### That it! You're all good to go!

Now that you have removed it from the startup programs and removed the entry on the registry, the malware should be gone and should never come back. My computer is now as clean as ever. If you would like to make sure that your computer is free from any malwares, you can download another tool from windows that would run a deep scan, or simply stop here. As for the tool that you downloaded, the **Autoruns for windows**, just keep it, maybe it will come in handy again if you come across a malware with similar behaviours, or delete it if you don't want to keep it.

### Run a deep scan with Windows Malicious Software Removal Tool.

You can [download the tool from windows website](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/malicious-software-removal-tool-details.aspx){:target="_blank"}. Once you downloaded the tool, **right click on it > Run as administrator** as shown in the image below:

![Registry](/blog/public/post-resources/2017-08-12-how-to-remove-win-gamarue-virus/Windows Malicious Software Removal Tool run as admin.png)

Then run a full scan, this scan will take a lot of time, mine took about 10 hours.
