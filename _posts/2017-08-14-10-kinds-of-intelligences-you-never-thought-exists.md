This is the bad thing about people these days, they don't even know what constitutes to **intelligence**. Why is it that you are intelligent when you are good at solving mathematical problems but not when you are good at singing, dancing, or crafting stuff?

Our society's education system has imposed the idea that when you excel at school and you get high grades you are intelligent but not when otherwise.

Surely, a failing test at school would mean that you are not intelligent for the subject, but surely as well, **the idea that you are not intelligent is not a good idea to carry around for the rest of your life**. Just because you failed on one of your exams, that doesn't mean you're not intelligent. One thing they didn't teach at school, is that, there are multiple kinds of intelligences, and not doing good at one kind of intelligence doesn't necessarily mean you won't do well on the rest.

# 10 kinds of intelligences

### Linguistic Intelligence

This is a kind of intelligence that poets, writers, journalists, translators, interpreters, and orators would excel at. They know for sure which words to use best on different situations and they really know how to construct their sentences really well to convey the ideas in their mind.

If you develop this intelligence, you would be good at making poems, essays, writing, reading, rhyming words, and constructing ideas. Learning new languages would also be easier for you.

### Logical-Mathematical Intelligence

This is a kind of intelligence that computer programmers, software developers, mathematicians, and engineers would excel at. They are really good at logic, abstractions, reasoning, numbers, and critical thinking. They can even put different complexities on top of each other to form a simplistic looking functionality.

If you develop this intelligence, you would be good at solving even complex problems, creating and reading graphs and diagrams. Your critical thinking would increase and your reasoning will improve.

### Spatial Intelligence

This is a kind of intelligence that sea captains, airplane pilots, and navigators would excel at. People who are good at arts and drawing would also excel in this kind of intelligence.

If you develop this intelligence you would be able to navigate on a vast space, you would remember where you've been even and how to get back there, you would also find it easier for you to read and follow maps.

### Interpersonal Intelligence

This is a kind of intelligence that mentors, coaches, and consultants would excel at. This is about understanding other people's emotions, knowing what motivates them, and what triggers their mood.

If you develop this intelligence, you would be able to understand other people even without experiencing their problem or situation. You would also be a good leader, mentor, or coach.

### Intrapersonal Intelligence

This intelligence is about self-awareness and understanding yourself. What motivates you, what triggers your mood, what are your strengths and weaknesses.

If you develop this intelligence you would be able to understand yourself more, you would be able to better set your goals in a way that aligns to your interests. You would also be able to control your thoughts and yourself a lot better.

### Bodily-Kinesthetic Intelligence

This is a kind of intelligence that dancers, athletes, martial artists, craftsman, and actors would excel at. This intelligence is about how you move and control your all parts of your body in rhythm with each other.

If you develop this intelligence, you'll find that parkour would be a lot easier and dancing is not a problem.

### Musical-rhythmic and Harmonic Intelligence

This is a kind of intelligence that musicians would excel at. This intelligence is about music, singing, and playing musical instruments.

If you develop this intelligence, you would be able to compose music, produce better pitch and rhythm, and sing better.

### Naturalistic Intelligence

This is about how you connect yourself to your environment and how you recognize the things that are in your environment such as trees, plants, and other animals. We can say that this is connected to **botany** and **biology**.

### Pedagogical Intelligence

This is a kind of intelligence that teachers, professors, mentors, and instructors would excel at. This intelligence allows us to teach ideas to other people. This kind of intelligence is rarely enhanced, let alone mastered. Take for example two learned persons, one of them can be a good teacher and the other is not.

### Existential Intelligence

This is a kind of intelligence that Philosophers would excel at. This intelligence allows us to ask big questions about life and existence itself. Questions like **What is the purpose of life?** or **Is there life after death?**. Everyone has this intelligence in them, even a child would ask himself, **What would I do when I grow up?**. The key difference between a child and a philosopher who have developed this intelligence to a high degree is that the philosopher gives attention to the answer and how that answer can be attacked by another philosophical question.

# We all have these intelligences in us

Yes we do, but their level would vary depending on how often we use them. For instance, bloggers can have more **linguistic intelligence** than computer programmers. A person who travels a lot would have more **spatial intelligence** than bloggers who don't.

###### Which one do you need?

We don't really use all of these intelligences at once but we can surely pair some of them to get better results. For instance a software developer can use his **logical-mathematical intelligence** together with his **interpersonal intelligence, intrapersonal intelligence, spatial intelligence,** and **linguistic intelligence**.

###### Which one to master?

If we can live for a very long time we can surely develop each intelligences to a very high degree but our current reality limits our lifespan to a very short time. So are you going to play your strength or bolster your weaknesses? it's really up to you. You can focus on a set of these or even just one of these, but if you're feeling a bit like **Sherlock Holmes**, you can surely try to be the **jack of all trades**.

# To answer the question

So the answer to the question on the top is **yes**. **Person A** accomplished what I tried to but couldn't. He is Intelligent.
