There are times when you want to deploy your web app project online maybe just to test it out or show it to someone, in this case, free hosting should be good enough.

# What is 000webhost?

Hostinger team created **000webhost** as an **educational platform** for learners to try their hobby projects. It offers free hosting with **no ads and no banners** using their subdomain. [Visit a test site that I created on 000webhost](http://aprilmintacpineda.000webhostapp.com/){:target="_blank"}. Go ahead and [visit their website](https://www.000webhost.com/996779.html){:target="_blank"}

# How to deploy your website on 000webhost for free

### Notice

- I will not go through creating your website. In this post I assume that you already have a website, or at least know how to create a website. The main goal of this post is to guide you in deploying your website online for free.
- Take note of the date this post was last updated vs the date you are reading this.

[Go to their website](https://www.000webhost.com/996779.html){:target="
_blank"} and create an account, you will need an active email for this. After registration they will send you an email with a link to verify your email.

![sign up form](/blog/public/post-resources/2017-08-16-deploy-your-site-with-000webhost-for-free/sign-up-form.png)

After registration, you will be automatically logged in and redirected to a page where all your websites are listed. If you scroll down you will see that you already have one website up that is **your-email.000webhostapp.com**. The status could be pending if you have not verified your email yet, but you can totally visit the site now. If you do, you will simply see a message from 000webhost, this is because the site is empty as of the moment, that means it does not have any files in it.

![website list page](/blog/public/post-resources/2017-08-16-deploy-your-site-with-000webhost-for-free/sign-up-form.png)

If you click on it or the **manage website button**, you will be taken to a page where you will see the statistics of the website.

# Uploading files

If you have verified your email, the only thing that's left is to upload your website's files and folders. On the top most part of the page, click on the **File Manager**.

![file-manager-button](/blog/public/post-resources/2017-08-16-deploy-your-site-with-000webhost-for-free/file-manager-button.png)

Scroll down a bit and click on **upload files now**, a new tab will open, just wait for the file manager to open.

The file manager looks like image below. By default there is only one file.

![file-manager](/blog/public/post-resources/2017-08-16-deploy-your-site-with-000webhost-for-free/file-manager.png)

On the top right of the page click on the upload button and select all the files that you want to upload. If your files are in a folder, you will not be able to upload them through this process, we will discuss that later. On my desktop I have a file called **index.html** I will upload that file. I recommend you create a file called **index.html** and upload that too so you can follow along.

![upload-files](/blog/public/post-resources/2017-08-16-deploy-your-site-with-000webhost-for-free/upload-files.png)

Once you have done that, you will now see the file you uploaded and you can visit your site now and view that page you uploaded.

# Uploading an entire project

I created a separate post for this. Please read the [Upload your site to 000webhost using FileZilla](/blog/how-tos/2017/08/16/upload-your-site-to-000webhost-using-filezilla/).

# Remove branding

If you see a banner on your website that says something like **powered by 000webhost**, you can remove this by going to your **Settings > General > Show 000webhost branding**, make sure this is **turned off**.
